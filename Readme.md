Scripts and Functions for Data Visualization and Specialized Plots

__Introduction__

Most of these plotting functions were the result of questions on stackoverflow.com or graphics that my colleagues wanted to make but were unsure how to develop. Some of the methods of representing the data were developed by others, but I did implement it in code. Generally, the code is designed to be easily "hacked" by users so that they can modify inputs to control the output. 

Currently, there are the following dependencies on R libraries: RcolorBrewer, grDevices, graphics.

The specialized plots available are: Taylor Diagram and Smoothed Desnity Estimate of Traces. More details are provided below.

__Smoothed Density Estimate of Traces__ (used for visualizing the probability density of traces over time or space)

The specialized plots currently available are:

__Taylor Diagram__ (used for comparing models with data)



More information on the functions is available in 'DOCUMENTATION.md'.
